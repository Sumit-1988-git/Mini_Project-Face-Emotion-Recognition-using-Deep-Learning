**Emotion Recognition Using CNN**
This repository contains an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying facial emotions. The model is trained on the FER2013 dataset, which classifies images into seven emotion categories:

Angry

Disgust

Fear

Happy

Neutral

Sad

Surprise

üõ†Ô∏è **Installation**
Clone the repository and install the required libraries:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-recognition-cnn.git
cd emotion-recognition-cnn
!pip install kaggle tensorflow matplotlib seaborn

üìÇ **Dataset**
The FER2013 dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle FER2013, and it consists of:

Training: 22,968 images

Validation: 5,741 images

Test: 7,178 images

Ensure to unzip the dataset and place it in the correct directory structure.

üß†** Model Architecture**

The CNN model consists of:

Convolutional Layers (Conv2D): To extract features.

MaxPooling Layers: To reduce dimensionality.

BatchNormalization & Dropout Layers: For regularization and avoiding overfitting.

Fully Connected (Dense) Layers: For classification into 7 emotion categories.

üñºÔ∏è **Inference**
To make predictions on a new image, use the predict_emotion function:

Run the function on any test image:

predict_emotion("/path/to/your/image.jpg")

üíæ **Save and Load Model**

Save Model:
To save your trained model, use:

model.save('emotion_model.h5')

Load Model:
To load a saved model for inference, use:


from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
model = load_model('emotion_model.h5')

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**

The steps outlined above represent one way to achieve a reasonable validation accuracy for this model. You can further improve the performance by experimenting with:

Data Augmentation: Increase the variety and quantity of training data to improve generalization.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Explore different values for learning rates, optimizer types, etc.

Additional Callbacks: Implement more advanced callbacks like ReduceLROnPlateau or ModelCheckpoint with different settings to boost model performance.
